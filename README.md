Thats my first streem project. I made a restaurant website. I used a template for free images and change all template from top to bottom. I made a voucher page and if you go to featured page i have made a food menu there. If you go to beer page I added a beer API so people can search beer and check if beer is organic or not and last one is contact us page i used a google frame for Restaurant location. For Seasons Restatueant i used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and BOOTSTRAP.
